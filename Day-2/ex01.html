      <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
      <p>
        This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about cooking technique called
        <em> sous vide </em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerde the
        food(usally vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is
        aprecisele set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked
        to. In this book, Cooking fir Greeks, Jeff Potter describes ir as
        "ultra-low temperature poaching".
